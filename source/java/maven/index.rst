Maven
=====

`Maven`_ is used to manage Java projects, as it allows not only handling
dependencies, but also setting up the development environment and the
artifacts creation.

Maven is a big tool, with a lot of features, but the most important ones
being used in the projects are as it follows:

- Dependencies control
- Artifacts generation, including documentation site
- Project templates (Maven archetypes)
- Project and environment configuration
- Running unit and integration tests

As it can be seen, there is a huge dependency to Maven during the development
process.

Maven will be used for generating Java artifacts and the Maven site, which
is used for holding the documentation.
