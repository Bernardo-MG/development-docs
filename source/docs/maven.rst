Maven

Maven includes the Maven site as a quick way to build a project site, including
information about the project, documentation and reports. All of this can be
generated as part of any normal Maven project lifecycle.

Sadly it is mostly outdated. But the `Docs Maven Skin`_ fixes some of these
problems.
