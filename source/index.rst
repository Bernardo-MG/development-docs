===========================
Wandrell's Development Docs
===========================

This aims to be a general purpose documentation for my own projects,
definining a series of procedures and practices to be followed.

It is not meant to document libraries or concrete implementations. Instead it
describes such things as project structures or the use of various technologies.

The projects created by following these rules can be found at my
`Github profile`_.
