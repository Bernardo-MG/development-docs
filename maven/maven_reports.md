# Maven Reports

Recommended Maven report plugins:

- [Changes](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-changes-plugin/), generates the changes report from the changes log.
- [Checkstyle](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-checkstyle-plugin/), checks that the source files comply with style standards.
- [Dependency](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-dependency-plugin/), generates the dependencies analysis report.
- [FindBugs](http://gleclaire.github.io/findbugs-maven-plugin/), checks for patterns which are prone to errors.
- [JaCoCo](http://eclemma.org/jacoco/trunk/doc/maven.html), generates coverage reports from Surefire and Failsafe.
- [JDepend](http://www.mojohaus.org/jdepend-maven-plugin/), generates the dependencies report.
- [Javadoc](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-javadoc-plugin/), generates the Javadocs.
- [JXR](http://maven.apache.org/jxr/maven-jxr-plugin/), generates references to the source files, used by other reports.
- [OWASP Dependency Check](https://jeremylong.github.io/DependencyCheck/), searches for dependencies with known vulnerabilities.
- [PMD](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-pmd-plugin/), checks that the code complies with a series of code quality rules.
- [Project Info](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-project-info-reports-plugin/), generates general information reports.
- [Site](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-site-plugin/), generates the Maven Site.
- [Surefire Report](https://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-report-plugin/), generates the unit tests report.
- [Taglist](http://www.mojohaus.org/taglist-maven-plugin/), generates a report of all the temporal tags still on the code.

These will be generated along the [Maven Site][maven-site].

The OWASP Dependency Check is very slow, so it is not recommended generating it with each build.

Check the [archetypes][archetypes] to find out how to set them up.
