# Maven

[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) is a Java project management tool for Java. In some aspects it may be too big, offering much more than what most people will need, and suffering integration problems with itself from time to time. Still, used with care it is really useful.

Its most useful aspects are:

* Dependency management
* Project management \(building, running tests, deploying...\)
* Generating documentation site
