# Paradigms

There are several ways of programming. Different languages will have a different take on each, for example Java is an imperative language, while Python is a functional one, but all the languages will follow the paradigms in similar ways.

For this it is recommended learning paradigms more than learning languages. While Python and Javascript are very different, they both share similarities thanks to being functional languages.

It is not rare for a language to mix paradigms.

## Imperative

The most commonly known. It gives orders to the application, telling it how to do things.

Java and C are imperative.

## Declarative

Gives instructions. Indicating what should be done, but not how.

HTML and SQL are declarative.

## Functional

Closer to mathematics than other paradigms, this is based on mathematical functions and stateless algorithms.

Javascript and Python are functional.
