# Documentation

All the projects should be documented, not only for anybody who may use them, but also for the programmer itself, as it is always hard retaking a project after months away from it.

There is not a single way to document a project, but it should be done in at least the following ways:
* A readme
* A generated documentation site
* Issues tracking

## Diagramns

Visual diagrams will follow the UML specifications.

The tool used for creating them us [UMLet][umlet], a free Eclipse-based UML editor. It is very simple, and this way allows a lot of flexibility, but is not capable of auto generating code.
