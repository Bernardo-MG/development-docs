# Logging

Keep logs in a single message.

## Levels Usage

| Level | Usage |
| :--- | :--- |
| Trace | The most detailed information, useful only for deep debugging. Logging calls to inner methods. |
| Debug | Fine grained information, for debugging. No long-term value. |
| Info | System announcements \(scheduled jobs, services starting/stopping\), configuration, version data, usage. |
| Warn | The system is not working as expected. |
| Error | The system has failed, critical failures. |
