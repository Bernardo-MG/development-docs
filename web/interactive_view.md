# Interactive View

Modern frameworks and tecnologies allow splitting the frontend and backend completely, transforming the view into an interactive client which handles all communication with the server.

## Example

A Spring MVC application offers REST web services. The client is a REACT with Redux client. Both the backend and frontend can be in different servers.

## Advantages

- Easier to generate interactive views
- Changing view does not require reloading
- Local context and data storage
- Frontend and backend dissociated

## Disadvantages

- Heavy frontend
- Requires more knowledge
- Sessions are harder to handle
