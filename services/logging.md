# Logging

Keep logs in a single message.

## Levels Usage

* Debug: fine grained information, for debugging. No long-term value
* Info: system announcements \(scheduled jobs, services starting/stopping\), configuration, version data, usage
* Warn: conditions which tell that the system is not working as expected
* Error: condition which tells the system has failed, critical failures
