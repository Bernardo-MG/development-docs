# Properties File

These contains pairs of key and value:

```properties
# A comment
key1=A value
key2=Another value
```

These files define a dictionary, and are usually used for configuration properties.

## Encoding

By the standard, properties files use the ISO-8859-1 format. This may cause formatting problems when reading or writing.
