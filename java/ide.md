# Java IDE

## Eclipse

[Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/) is the recommended Java IDE.

There are many versions and packages. Usually the "Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers" package is enough, but it may require installing plugins for specific projects, for example when working with a project which uses React.

### Code style

Eclipse supports XML configuration for its code style formatter.

The following files are set for recommended configurations:

* [Java code style](https://github.com/Bernardo-MG/eclipse-code-style/blob/master/Eclipse-Format-Java.xml), a mix of various standards.
* [Javascript code style](https://github.com/Bernardo-MG/eclipse-code-style/blob/master/Eclipse-Format-JS.xml), a mix of various standards.
