# Java Artifacts Deployment

There is no official repository for Java artifacts. So were they are deployed will depend on the project management tool being used.

Maven and Gradle are the most popular options.

## Packages

JAR and WAR files can be deployed. Any additional requirement will depend on the tools and services being used.
