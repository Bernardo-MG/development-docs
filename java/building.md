# Building the Project

## JDK

### From source code

It is not recommended building Java projects manually. But if needed follow these steps.

First compile the file to run:

```
javac App.java
```

Then run it:

```
java App
```

### JAR

JAR files are ready to be used:

```
java -jar App.jar
```

## Maven

Maven takes care of all the important tasks when building a project. As long as it is correctly configured.

For more information check the [building with Maven][maven_building] section.
