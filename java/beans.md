# Java Beans

A bit of convention and a bit of old specification, Java Beans are a common way to generate data objects in Java.

## Main Points

Java beans should:

* Have a \(explicit\) default constructor
* Contain getters and setters for all the fields

## Usage

Some libraries, such as JPA implementations, will require data objects to fit the Java Bean specification, and may add additional restrictions.
