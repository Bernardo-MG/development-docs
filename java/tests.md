# Tests

## Test Frameworks

The test frameworks available for Java are:

* [Junit](junit.org) \(recommended\)
* [TestNG](testng.org)

Junit integrates quick with Spring, Eclipse and any additional framework or library needed for the tests.

## Mocking

[Mockito](site.mockito.org) can be used for mocking dependencies.
