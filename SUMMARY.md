# Development Docs

This is a personal programming guide and code base, to help myself when developing a software project.

It explains the methodologies I use and prefer, how to use them and if possible it explains decisions I took. This way I can keep a knowledge base, instead of going through a process of forgetting and re-learning when retaking an old project.

As it is just a helping tool, it does not aim to be an in-depth guide. It expects a certain grade of knowledge about computer science and software technologies.
