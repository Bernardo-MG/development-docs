# PyPi

[PyPi][pypi] is a package repository for Python. Along with [pip][pip] it can be used for dependency management.

## Dependency management

This is already covered in the PyPi documentation and many tutorials.

It will be enough saying that dependencies are defined in the requirements.txt file inside the Python projects.

[pip]: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip
[pypi]: https://pypi.python.org/pypi
