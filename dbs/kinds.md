# Database Kinds

When developing there are two important kinds of databases: embedded and external databases.

The embedded ones are included along the application, as if they were just another file, while external ones will require a service and some sort of connection.

## Embedded databases

Embedded databases are useful during development and for testing.

Some of them may be used as embedded or external databases, depending on configuration.

These are some databases used embedded:

- [H2](http://www.h2database.com)
- [HSQLDB](http://hsqldb.org/)

## External databases

- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
